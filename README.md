#### 🚀 Animating an AI-Controlled Robot Arm with Gemini Robotics, SVG, and GSAP

Watch an AI-controlled robot arm in action! The system interprets the scene and your instruction, then plans one or more sequences of shoulder and elbow angle combinations to complete tasks like reaching, grabbing, and manipulating objects, performing multiple actions in sequence. Each trajectory is validated with Zod and animated smoothly using SVG and GSAP.
